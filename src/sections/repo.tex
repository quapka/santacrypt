\subsection{The repository structure}
The project is using Git for its version control and it is mainly a Python package. The following paths are relative from the directory \projectroot, which is the root of the Git repository. The Python sources are in \filepath{javus/}, the attacks' source codes are in \filepath{javus/data/attacks/<attack-name>} in respective directories. The file \filepath{javus/data/registry.ini} defines which attacks are enabled. The main command line utility is called \javus. Full Git repository description is in Appendix~\ref{sec:gitrepo}.
